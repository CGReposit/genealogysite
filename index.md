### Personal Note 📝 (Dani)


Let me preface this by saying I always thought family trees were <ins>dumb</ins> 

I never felt compelled to create one. It's something I always thought was cringy. 

But thanks to modern technology (ditigization and AI), tracing one’s lineage has arguably never been easier; often requiring nothing more than a simple search of the last name in the correct database 🕵🏻‍♂️ For all of my cynicism, I now have to admit that having a geneaology tree made is quite fascinating - especially because what I found is not what I expected.

Part of the reason I had no interest in geneaology is because I believed (and still do) that it has no practical effect on the present. Life does not change simply because you found out what year your ancestor entered through Ellis Island. Nonetheless, researching ancestry does give a deeper understanding of how societies lived before us. In many ways you will find that it was quite different to now... in other ways surprisingly not. This gives a more personal, human-scale perspective on the past that is entirely different to learning about it in a dark classroom conveniently scheduled right after lunchtime 😴 seriously, whose idea was that? How are we <em>not</em> expected to fall asleep. Do you know how <ins>boring</ins> Colonial American history is? Like, I really dont care what a bunch of religious farmers were up to in the 1600s-1700s 🙄 

But the dynamics of history change a little bit when you realize you are the <strong>direct descendent</strong> of people whose lives were shaped by such events. Idk, ya'll might not find all of this as interesting as I did. But it's still funny to be able to say that for all of our foreignness, we still have a lineage in the United States that spans back <em>MUCH FARTHER</em>  than the nativist, immigrant-hating racist we currently have as president. However, after this thorough ancestral review that has required a deep look a American history, I can also say it's easy to spot how the past has shaped our present.

Easy research quickly yielded an unmanageable volume of data. Since existing genealogy-tracking websites couldn't fully integrate all the information I was gathering from multiple sources, I decided to get creative and just build my own repository for this information 🗃️ Mainly, this website serves as an enormous personal project to learn the HTML coding basics behind creating a website (which i think went well!🤞🏼) - and to give my Dad and siblings this repository of information I believe they should also have access to. My lineage is also their lineage after all.



## Index

This project yielded unexpected volumes of information: both on family history and American History. Overall, this family is quite truly the Forrest Gump of American families. Wherever there is a historic, era-defining event unfolding, this family is <em>THERE</em> ✊🏻 Highly interesting shit.

### Resources used for research:

**FamilySearch** - is a free website sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormons) that provides genealogical software to help people discover their family history. It is one of the world's largest genealogical resources, with millions of historical records and a vast, collaborative family tree that helps users establush a lineage. The service is free for the public to use (log in required).

  <strong>Ellis Island records</strong> — The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation maintains a searchable database of approximately 65 million passenger records for the Port of New York from 1820 to 1957.  
  The records include ship manifests with details like name, age, nationality, and port of departure, as well as other details of interest.  
  This repository is open to the public (but requires making a free account).

  <strong>US Census Data</strong> — Since 1790, the US census has been significant for its role in apportioning political representation, federal funding allocation, and (most importantly in this case) as a rich genealogical and demographic record of the American people. Census data is collected every 10 years. Once 72 years have passed, the census records become publicly accessible. The 1950 census is the most recent one to be made public.

### American History

In 2026, The United States of America will celebrate the 250th annversary of its founding on July 4th 1776. As far as nations go, the US is quite a recent and unique one. The many nations of the Old World have legacies that span millenea. At most, the events leading to the founding of the modern United States can be traced to the 1500s-1600s; as a byproduct of European colonization on the continent. Regardless, in that short amount of time (250 years) the United States managed to become one of the most influential nations of contemporary history - pioneering a consitutional republic that serves as the basis for most modern democracies today. Despite the many (many) grievences we may have with current events in the United States, its achievements in such a remarklably short amount of time can be considered "great"... in my opinion. 

Namely, for the purposes of geneaological research, we can be quite thankful our lineage can be traced in America because of the US Census. The United States Census is special because it is one of the oldest and most comprehensive population counts in the world, mandated by the U.S. Constitution itself - it is a foundational part of American democracy. 

Conducted every ten years since 1790, the census directly determines political representation by deciding how seats in the House of Representatives are apportioned among the states. It also guides the distribution of hundreds of billions of federal dollars for schools, infrastructure, healthcare, and other public services. Beyond its governmental role, the census provides an invaluable historical record and a detailed snapshot of the American people. 


To my knowledge, both of my paternal grandparents were first-generation Americans. While that is true for one, the story could not be more different for the other.
