## Index

This project yielded unexpected volumes of information: both on family history and American History. Overall, this family is quite truly the Forrest Gump of American families. Wherever there is a historic, era-defining event unfolding, this family is <em>THERE</em> ✊🏻 Highly interesting shit.

### Resources used for research:

**FamilySearch** - is a free website sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormons) that provides genealogical software to help people discover their family history. It is one of the world's largest genealogical resources, with millions of historical records and a vast, collaborative family tree that helps users establush a lineage. The service is free for the public to use (log in required).

  <strong>Ellis Island records</strong> — The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation maintains a searchable database of approximately 65 million passenger records for the Port of New York from 1820 to 1957.  
  The records include ship manifests with details like name, age, nationality, and port of departure, as well as other details of interest.

  <strong>US Census Data</strong> — Since 1790, the US census has been significant for its role in apportioning political representation, federal funding allocation, and (most importantly in this case) as a rich genealogical and demographic record of the American people. Census data is collected every 10 years. Once 72 years have passed, the census records become publicly accessible. The 1950 census is the most recent one to be made public.

### American History

In 2026, The United States of America will celebrate the 250th annversary of its founding on July 4th 1776. As far as nations go, the US is quite a recent and unique one. The many nations of the Old World have legacies that span millenea. At most, the events leading to the founding of the modern United States can be traced to the 1500s-1600s; as a byproduct of European colonization on the continent. Regardless, in that short amount of time (250 years) the United States managed to become one of the most influential nations of contemporary history - pioneering a consitutional republic that serves as the basis for most modern democracies today. Despite the many (many) grievences we may have with current events in the United States, its achievements in such a remarklably short amount of time can be considered "great"... in my opinion. 

Namely, for the purposes of geneaological research, we can be quite thankful our lineage can be traced in America because of the US Census. The United States Census is special because it is one of the oldest and most comprehensive population counts in the world, mandated by the U.S. Constitution itself - it is a foundational part of American democracy. 

Conducted every ten years since 1790, the census directly determines political representation by deciding how seats in the House of Representatives are apportioned among the states. It also guides the distribution of hundreds of billions of federal dollars for schools, infrastructure, healthcare, and other public services. Beyond its governmental role, the census provides an invaluable historical record and a detailed snapshot of the American people. 


To my knowledge, both of my paternal grandparents were first-generation Americans. While that is true for one, the story could not be more different for the other.
