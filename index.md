### Personal Note 📝

Let me preface this by saying I always thought family trees were <ins>dumb</ins>. 

I never felt compelled to create one. It's something I always thought of as cringy. 

Thanks to modern technology, however, tracing one's lineage has become considerably easier; often requiring nothing more than a simple search of the last name in the correct database 🕵🏻‍♂️ 

For all of my cynicism, I have to admit that to now have a family tree made is quite cool - especially because what I found out about my lineage and the people who comprise it is not what I had expected.

Part of the reason I had no interest in genealogy is because I believed (and still do) that it has no practical effect on the present. Life does not change simply because you found out what year your ancestor entered through Ellis Island 🗽 

Nonetheless, researching personal family history connects you to wider historical events, like wars, migrations, or social movements. This gives a personal, human-scale perspective on the past that is entirely different to reading about it in textbooks.

Easy research quickly yielded an unmanageable volume of data. Since existing genealogy-tracking websites couldn't fully integrate all the information I was gathering from multiple sources, I decided to get creative and just build my own repository for this information. 

Mainly, this webpage served as an enormous personal project to learn the HTML coding basics behind creating a website - and to give my Dad and siblings this repository of information I believe they should also have access to.

## Index

This project yielded unexpected volumes of information: both on family history and American History. Highly interesting shit.

### Resources used for research:

**FamilySearch** - is a free website sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormons) that provides genealogical software to help people discover their family history. It is one of the world's largest genealogical resources, with millions of historical records and a vast, collaborative family tree that helps users establish a lineage. The service is free for the public to use (log in required). 

<div class="mobile-resource-section">

  <strong>Ellis Island records</strong> — The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation maintains a searchable database of approximately 65 million passenger records for the Port of New York from 1820 to 1957.
  <br><br>
  The records include ship manifests with details like name, age, nationality, and port of departure, as well as other details of interest.

  This repository is open to the public (but requires making a free account).

**US Census Data** - Since 1790, the US census has been significant for its role in apportioning political representation, federal funding allocation, and (most importantly in this case) as a rich genealogical and demographic record of the American people. Census data is collected every 10 years, once 72 years have passed, the census records become publicly accessible. The 1950 census is the most recent one to be made public.
