### Introduction

Let me preface this by saying I always thought family trees were <ins>dumb</ins> 

I never felt compelled to create one. It's something I always though of as cringy. However, times have changed, and technological advancements have made it considerably easier to trace one’s lineage by simply conducting a search by last name 🔎🕵🏻‍♂️ and I can't deny it's quite cool to be able to look all of this up.

Having done some easy research, I began to compile more information than I knew what to do with; tracking the lineages of people you don't know through multiple sources is incredibly tedious. Most websites that I found for geneaology-tracking didn't really have a mechanism to fully show all the information I was collecting from different sources. To that end, I decided to get creative and create my own repository of information.
