> Remember, remember always, that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and revolutionists

- Franklin D. Roosevelt (1938)

### Intro

Let me preface this by saying I always thought family trees were <ins>dumb</ins> 

I never felt compelled to create one. It's something I always though of as cringy. However, times have changed, and technological advancements have made it considerably easier to trace one’s lineage by simply conducting a search by last name 🔎🕵🏻‍♂️ and I can't deny it's quite cool to be able to look all of this up.

Having done some easy research, I began to compile more information than I knew what to do with; tracking the lineages of people you don't know through multiple sources is incredibly tedious. Most websites that I found for geneaology-tracking didn't really have a mechanism to fully show all the information I was collecting from different sources. To that end, I decided to get creative and create my own repository of information.

## Lineage and surname etymology

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.

Resources used for research:

FamilySearch - is a free website sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormons) that provides genealogical software to help people discover their family history. It is one of the world's largest genealogical resources, with millions of historical records and a vast, collaborative family tree that helps users establush a lineage. The service is free for the public to use (log in required). 

Ellis Island records - The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation maintains a searchable database of approximately 65 million passenger records for the Port of New York from 1820 to 1957. The records include ship manifests with details like name, age, nationality, and port of departure, as well other details of interest. This repository is open to the public (but requires making a free account). 

US Census Data - Since 1790, the US census has been significant for its role in apportioning political representation, federal funding allocation, and (most importantly in this case) as a rich genealogical and demographic record of the American people. Census data is collected every 10 years, once 72 years have passed, the census records become publicly accessible. The 1950 census is the most recent one to be made public.
