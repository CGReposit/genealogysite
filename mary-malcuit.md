## Historical Notes

**[Entry into the United States]**

Maria "Mary" Favini was born in 1901 in Varallo Pombia, a small town in the province of Novara, northern Italy. She immigrated to the United States on **July 19, 1913** at the age of 24 aboard the ship *Napoli*, which departed from the Port of Genoa on June 30, 1913.

Her immigration records indicate that her father, **Guiseppe Favini**, was her listed relative in Italy. She traveled with a 16-year-old boy, **Stefano Albertalli**, most likely a relative, and both listed **Enrico Albertalli** in West Hoboken, New Jersey, as their final U.S. destination.

She married **Maurice Malcuit**, a French immigrant originally from the Paris region, and settled in New Jersey. Together they had at least two children: **Jeannette Angela Malcuit** (later Commerford) and **John Malcuit**.

Records describe her as a *"house woman"* in her immigration manifest. Her listed height was 5 ft 1 in (155 cm), with brown hair and brown eyes — details that provide a vivid glimpse into her early life as an Italian immigrant to America in the early 20th century.
