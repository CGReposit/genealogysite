## The Etymology of the family surname

**Etymology** is the study of the origin and history of words, tracing how their meanings have changed over time. It examines a word's historical development, including its sources, forms, and evolution through different languages and periods.

Last names like "_Favini_" (Italian) or "_O'Niell_" (Irish) have more intuitive origins. _Commerford_, however, is a little more ambiguous. It was never clear to me whether it was from Great Britain or the island of Ireland. We have ancestors from both, but the original individual (or individuals) who brought that surname to the United States from the British Isles is unclear. What is likely, though, is that it was brought over _before_ the Declaration of Independance in 1776.

## Personal note:
One conclusion I have come to while tracking the lineage and origins of so many people I had never heard of (but that we are the direct descendents of?) is that the last name you inherit is a matter of complete chance. The circumstances of history are visible in a lot of these individual's lives when you research them. Many have been drafted into wars, escaped famines, and lived through some very difficult social conditions both while coming to and living in America. Our last name could have been "Commerford" as easily as it could've been anything else. 

With that being said, the surname is by far the most interesting (mostly because of the persons who carried it). Its linguistic origins are still pretty unclear after some research. But this is what I found about our surname's etymology:
