# Enhanced Genealogy Site

A personal project created to consolidate genealogical information and be able to present it in a structured, readable format. 

Rather than relying exclusively on any one service, this site serves as an off-line inventory of information found during geneaological research. 

The goal here is a double one: I want to improve coding and web-design. So creating a clean, web-based format that can take the fragmented research I am doing into a coherent and accessible reference is the objective. 

This is a good way to learn how to use HTML and CSS basics to design a site that is clear and is easy to navigate
