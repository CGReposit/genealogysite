# Enhanced Genealogy Site

A personal project 📽️💻

I have never felt compelled to create a genealogy tree. I also found it cringy when people displayed one and made a significant deal about ancestors they had never met. However, times have changed, and scientific advancements have made it considerably easier to trace one’s lineage by simply conducting a search for one’s last name. 

After some research, I found out interesting things about the American side of my lineage. For starters, its shockingly well documented and accessable through census databases and document recovery. I knew pratically nothing about my dad's lineage past my grandparents. When I realized my dad didn't have an extensive knowledge either, I decided to create an interactive website and geanological tree where he (or any of my siblings) can freely look up our family history. Given that most sources are dispersed, require some form of login to access, and just generally time consuming to find, I decided to compile all this in an innovative way my dad can access this info even from his phone.
