**Spelling variants and why they vary**

Spelling variation is a constant in medieval and early-modern records. Variants you will commonly encounter include: Comerford, Commerford, Comberford, Quemerford, Comford, Cummerford and occasional corruptions like Compford/Compfort in very early documents. Variant spellings can reflect regional dialect, the scribe’s ear, the process of anglicising Irish forms, and later standardization. By the 16th–17th centuries the spelling Comerford became common in Irish records, with Commerford appearing as a recognized variant in Britain and in emigrant records.

**History in America**

Bearers of the surname began appearing in New World records from the 18th century onward. Irish and Anglo-Irish emigrants with the name landed in various American colonies and later U.S. states; by the 19th century there was a noticeable presence in census and immigration lists. Large-scale Irish emigration in the mid-19th century (famine and economic migration) boosted the number of Comerford/Commerford families in the United States; family histories and parish/genealogical notes record specific families emigrating in the 1840s and 1850s and settling in New York, the Midwest (Illinois, Minnesota), and other states. Census compilations show the name occurring in the U.S. steadily through the 19th and 20th centuries, with concentrations in states that attracted Irish settlers



**English place-name origin 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿**

In England the name derives from a medieval place-name formed from Old English elements (a personal/ethnic name or topographical element combined with ford, meaning a river crossing). Early spellings recorded in various documents include forms like Comberford, Quemerford and related variants; these reflect regional pronunciation and medieval orthographic instability. Habitational surnames—those taken from the name of a village, manor or small locality—are common in England, and Commerford/Comerford fits that pattern.

**Early history and presence in Ireland 🇮🇪**

Comerford/Commerford families appear in Irish sources from the medieval and early modern periods. The family is commonly associated with the Norman influx into Ireland (late 12th–13th centuries) and settled principally in counties Kilkenny, Waterford and later Tipperary and Wexford. Over generations the originally Anglo-Norman family became integrated into Irish society, adopting Gaelic customs and, in some branches, Gaelicized versions of the name. Scholarly and antiquarian pedigrees (19th century) trace notable branches — for example the Comerfords of Ballyburley and other landed lines in Kilkenny — and record arms and genealogical trees for local elites.
